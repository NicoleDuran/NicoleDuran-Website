        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Nicole Duran. I am a student at University of California, Riverside. I was previously an Economics major but have now declared as Pre Business. This is my first year at this school. I have been on campus but most of my classes have been online or hybrid. Now in my second quarter I am now attending most of my classes in person or on certain occasions there are some classes that are in hybrid mode. Even with this current situation I have been able to adapt and accommodate myself to the different choices of schooling. I am a very flexible person that can work in any and most environments as I am very determined. Personally, I am someone that is determined to do well in school. That means that I am determined to study, reach out to professors, attend help sessions with teacher assistants, and do whatever possible to get my work done in a timely manner.
<br><br>

         I do believe that hard work and determination truly pays off. My goal is to be able to get a job that I not only enjoy but that I know is significant to the success of whatever company or organizationâ€™s success. And because of that, I believed Business as a major could help me out with that goal. Business is a universal source that has many job openings. With the major I have chosen I get to learn a little bit of everything in the industry. Not only that but when I get that glimpse of information I get to choose my concentration whether it be marketing, management, accounting, and so much more. The job I have in mind is as a storage and distribution manager which in order for me to get into that field I need a concentration of business administration and management. Storage and distribution managers plan, direct, and coordinate the storage and distribution operations of materials and products within a business. This job requires having frequent face to face discussions with other people, working with others as a team, and spending a fair amount of time on the phone. Also, several years of experience in the field is required by most employers for this management position. 
<br><br>

        Employers favor applicants with degrees in business administration, marketing and distribution. It would also be beneficial to have knowledge in two or more languages, it is more favorable in this work area. This job asks for: -Decision-making: weighing out the options in a situation or a problem - Actively looking for ways to help people - Listening: taking time to understand the points being made - Managing time -Using mathematics and/or statistics to solve problems - Reading comprehension of complex written paragraphs, instructions, or reports - Reasoning and using logic to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions - Social perceptiveness: being aware of the reactions of others, and understanding why they react the way they do - Speaking: talking, giving speeches, or speaking in a group to convey information, explain ideas, or give instructions.
